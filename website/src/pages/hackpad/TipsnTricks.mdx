# Tips'n Tricks

Here I will write out some tips and trics I learnt about in my designs. Feel free to add any of yours!

- Google is your best friend, search up anything u don't know. (And the cake is a lie :P)
- Spam vias everywhere! They are free.
- Try routing everything on one layers first, if you can't without making a big loop, move to the second layer. This keeps your board clean.
- Make multiple revisions! I rerouted my first macropad like 10 times while adding stuff.
- After routing everything, run Tools > Cleanup Tracks & Vias. You gotta press the Build changes button twice for the optimizations to apply.
- Use a ground fill, they are good!
- Try adding capacitors, they will increase your board stability.
- When soldering, wipe your tip on hot sponge periodically.
- With kmk, you can control your mouse with buttons! See Mouse keys in the docs.
- Maybe use some thicker traces! Edit the trace width a at the top left "Track: use netclass width", click edit predefined and add yours. Then select it in the same menu.
- Use tunnels to keep your schematic organised
