# Cyao's Tips'n Tricks

Heya! Welcome to my little cozy corner in the guide :D

Here I will write out some tips and trics I learnt about in my designs. Feel free to add any of yours!

- Spam vias everywhere! They are free.
- Try routing everything on one layers first, if you can't without making a big loop, move to the second layer. This keeps your board clean.
- Make multiple revisions! I rerouted my first macropad like 10 times while adding stuff.
- After routing everything, run Tools > Cleanup Tracks & Vias. You gotta press the Build changes button twice for the optimizations to apply.
