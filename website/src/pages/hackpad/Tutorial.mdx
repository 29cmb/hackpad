# Make your own Hackpad! 

Hey! Want to make your own macropad but have absolutely no clue where to start? You found the right place! In this tutorial, we're going to make a 4-key macropad as an example. **For a full submission, you will have to edit it to be your own** (add an extra key?? a knob?? new case? up to you!)

**Read over the [FAQ](/faq) first so that you have an idea of what you're working with!**

This process is going to be broken into 3 parts, each with its own sub-parts:

There's also [this](/resources) giant wall of resources to reference!

Here is also a guide on [advanced PCB components](/advancedPCB)

[Don't forget to find out some Tips'n Tricks here!](/tipsntricks)

Lets start with:

<a name="pcb_design"/>
## Designing your PCB

For this guide we're going to be using [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/), which is an open source PCB designer tool.   

To start, we're going to have to install the kicad library! We are going to use the following respository
- [OPL Kicad Library](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/OPL_Kicad_Library/) 

There are many tutorials on how to install libraries! Google is your best friend here :)

@Cyao in the slack did make an awesome tutorial though! Here it is:

<a name="schematic"/>
### Drawing the Schematic

Start by opening up KiCad, a window will pop up, create a new project then click on the "Schematic Editor" button:

<img src="/docs/v2/schematicbutton.png" className="max-w-96" />

This should open up a new window with your schematic editor! Once you're in, press the A key on your keyboard. This should open up a menu where you can add **symbols** for your different components! Search for the following to add them:
- XIAO-RP2040-DIP (your microcontroller)
- SW_Push (This will be our keyboard switch! Copy and paste this 4 times)
- SK6812 MINI LED (its an RGB LED - I will be using 2 of these!)

Start by placing these symbols down. They don't have to be in any particular order, but place them somewhat close together

To rotate the symbols, click R. And to mirror them, click X.

<img src="/docs/v2/placedcomponents.png" className="max-w-96" />

Afterwards, it should look something like this ^^

Now it's time to start wiring. Hit the W key on your keyboard to start wiring! This should make a green wire start to appear. Connect your components like so:

<img src="/docs/v2/wiredcomponents.png" className="max-w-96" />

Don't forget to add the GND and +5V symbols! Press P and search for it.

Once all the components are connected, we can start assigning **footprints** to the symbols we have here. Footprints are what gets physically drawn on the PCB. To do this, click the "run footprint assignment tool" in the top right.

<img src="/docs/v2/assignfootprints.png" className="max-w-96" />

This should open up a window where you can assign different footprints to your components! Assign them based on the image below:

<img src="/docs/v2/assignedfootprints.png" className="max-w-200" />

Once you're done, you can hit apply & save schematic. We're now officially done with the schematic! Onto making the pcb itself:

<a name="routing"/>
### Routing the PCB

Great job on finishing the schematic! Hit this button to open the PCB editor: 

<img src="/docs/v2/switchtopcb.png" className="max-w-96" />

Hit the "Update PCB from schematic" button in the top right. This will bring in all your parts!

<img src="/docs/v2/updatefromschematic.png" className="max-w-96" />

Click anywhere on your screen to place your components down, it should look something like this:

<img src="/docs/v2/pcbstart.png" className="max-w-96" />

First, to be able to better place the components, we would need to change the grid. 

Grids are used to allow efficient placement, movement and connection between symbols and wires. It defines what is the spacing of the grid, which components will snap to.

Select the button at the top that says "1.2700 mm (50 mils)" (Replace xx by a arbitrary number). You can use this menu to change what grid you are on. hen click on Edit Grids...

<img src="/docs/v2/grid.png" className="max-w-96" />

You should have the following menu open:

<img src="/docs/v2/editgrid.png" className="max-w-96" />

Now click on the + button at the bottom left, and enter "2.38125" in the field named "X". Press Ok then Ok again. Now you have defined a cutom grid!

We now need to place the components!

Select a footprint, drag it around to move it (Or if you prefer, click a component to select it, press M to move it and click again to put it down). To rotate the footprint, press R when selecting it.

When placing the switches, I recommend you to use the newly defined grid of 2.38125 mm (Select it in the menu). **Important**: While moving the switches, select the blue circle at the center. This will make sure all the switches are alighed properly. You should align the outer while lines of the switches as so:

<img src="/docs/v2/align.png" className="max-w-96" />

There is a front side and back side of the board. You can tell them apart by color

<img src="/docs/v2/frontback.png" className="max-w-96" />

If you want to put the footprint on the back side, press F. Here is what the footprints look like on different sides:

<img src="/docs/v2/compfrontback.png" className="max-w-96" />

Move, rotate and flip your footprints into a design that you like! It should looks like this:

<img src="/docs/v2/placedfootprints.png" className="max-w-96" />

You need to define the outline of the board. Select the Edge.Cuts layer on the right toolbar.

<img src="/docs/v2/righttoolbar.png" className="max-w-96" />

Now, you can use the "Draw Rectangle" button to draw the boarders of the board:

<img src="/docs/v2/edgecutsselect.png" className="max-w-96" />

This shall be the size of your physical board.

**IMPORTANT**! Remember to have the head of the XIAO poking out of the Edge.Cuts rectangle. This is mandatory to be able to plug your USB cable in.

<img src="/docs/v2/xiaohead.png" className="max-w-96" />

Now it's time to route the PCB! Hit X on your keyboard and hit any golden pad with a thin blue line poking out. It should dim the entire screen and show you where to go:

<img src="/docs/v2/routing.png" className="max-w-96" />

Join the highlighted pads together. If there isn't enough space on the front side, or there is a trace already present that is blocking you, you can route on the back side by clicking B.Cu on the right toolbar. At the same time, if you want to change sides during routing, you can press V, and a via shall be added, and you will be on the other side of the board:

<img src="/docs/v2/via.png" className="max-w-96" />

**Attention**! Wires and pads of different colors (except golden) can't be connected together directly! You must via to the other side.

Continue until there are no thin blue lines on the screen! Your final product should look something like this:

<img src="/docs/v2/finalpcb.png" className="max-w-96" />

Also, it is **VERY IMPORTANT** that you brand your hackpad! Put the name of your hackpad on any silkscreen of your PCB. Do this by using the text tool. Also, write "XIAO HERE" on the side you would like your XIAO to be placed on. 

To do this select F.Silkscreen (If your xiao is on the back side, use B.Silkscreen when placing the "XIAO HERE" text), and click on the add text button:

<img src="/docs/v2/addtext.png" className="max-w-96" />

Enter your text and place it down! 

<img src="/docs/v2/realfinalpcb.png" className="max-w-96" />

Good stuff! You're almost done the PCB. Let's run the DRC to make sure the PCB works. The silkscreen warnings you see are okay, make sure there are no more errors! Here is a [list of all DRC errors you might encounter](/errors)

<img src="/docs/v2/drcbutton.png" className="max-w-96" />

PS. You might need to cheange tabs to see all errors. (Click on "Unconnected Items")

Thats all for your PCB! Great job.

If you aren't satisfied and wan't something more advanced, [check out the advanced PCB guide!](/advancedPCB)

<a name="3d_models"/>
### Bonus: 3D models!

You currently can view the 3D version of your PCB by pressing Alt+3 (Option+3 on some platforms). It should look something like this:

<img src="/docs/v2/3d-view.png" className="max-w-96" />

Oh no! We are missing some 3D Models. Here we will learn how you add them.

First, you must find 3D Models for your components on the internet, but here if @Cyao's trusty list of common models. (If this opens a new tab and doesn't automatically download, press Control+S)

Note: On some Linux distributions, you need to download the built-in kicad 3d models seperatly, most likely called "kicad-library-3d"

Now open the footprint editor:

<img src="/docs/v2/footprinteditor.png" className="max-w-96" />

In the editor, search for the component you want to add the model to, and double click it, you should have something like this: (I'm taking SK6812MINI as an example)

<img src="/docs/v2/editfootprint.png" className="max-w-96" />

If you don't have your own library yet, click File > New Library... and select Project. Name the library anything you like. 

<img src="/docs/v2/newlibrary.png" className="max-w-96" />

If you want to add a 3d model to a footprint that was supplied by kicad, you need to create a copy of it.

Right click the footprint in the left menu bar and click Copy Footprint.

<img src="/docs/v2/copyfootprint.png" className="max-w-96" />

Search for your library, right click on it and click Paste Footprint.

<img src="/docs/v2/pastefootprint.png" className="max-w-96" />

Now click File > Footprint Proprerities... And you should have a new window, select "3D Models" at the top:

<img src="/docs/v2/3dmodels.png" className="max-w-96" />

If you don't have anything in the "3D Model(s)" frame, click on the + icon. After that, click on the file icon on the right and choose the coresponding 3D model that you downloaded. Now you have something like this:

<img src="/docs/v2/neopixel3d.png" className="max-w-96" />

If nothing is showing, make sure you checked the Show checkbox.

We need to rotate and move it. Press the + and - buttons on the rotation tab until it is at the right orientation, then the + and - buttons at the offset tab until you have the right position. Mine will be like this: (The + and - might be up and down arrows on some platforms)

<img src="/docs/v2/correctneopixel3d.png" className="max-w-96" />

Repeat this process for all the parts that are missing models. If you created copies of footprints, you need to re-assign the footprints to **your own** versions in the schematic editor. Go back to the PCB editor and re-click "Update PCB from schematic"

Now go to Tools > Update Footprints from Library... and click Update on the new window.

<img src="/docs/v2/updatefromlib.png" className="max-w-96" />

After all the work, you will have something like this when you press Alt+3 (Or Option+3):

<img src="/docs/v2/3dwithcomponents.png" className="max-w-96" />

Now to export the PCB as a 3D Model, select File > Export > STEP...

<img src="/docs/v2/exportstep.png" className="max-w-96" />

And select the directory you want the output to be in, then click Export. You don't need to change any settings. In the end you will get a .STEP file, that is the 3D model of your PCB.

<a name="case_design_common"/>
## Common case design part

First thing first, go to [ai03's plate generator](https://kbplate.ai03.com/).

In the KLE Data fiels, you need to enter some custom json data. For example

["", "", ""],
["", "", ""],

Is for a macropad that has 3 keys in each column and 2 rows

If your keyboard is more complex, you can use [keyboard-layout-editor.com](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) to generate the json data. (Modify the layout, open the "Raw data" tab at the middle of the page and copy & paste)

After that, scroll down and look at the preview to verify if it conforms to your macropad, and press download DXF.

Now that you are done with generating your plates, it's time to choose which 3d modeling sofware you want to use. We have guides for the following softwares:

- [Figma Case Design](#case_design_fusion)
- [FreeCad Case Design](#case_design_freecad)

<a name="case_design_fusion"/>
## Creating your case in Fusion360

- Difficulty: 2/5

This guide uses [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal) for designing the case. You can use other software, but it may be harder to follow along!

<a name="bottom"/>
### Creating the bottom
Start by creating a new project, and a new component, this is better for organization. 

<img src="/docs/v2/newcomponent.png" className="max-w-96" />

Next, create a sketch by by pressing the green + button. Create a rectangle that is 0.5mm bigger than your hackpad's PCB. For example, my PCB is 42mm x 61.5mm, I added 0.5mm to each on the sketch.

<img src="/docs/v2/1sketch1.png" className="max-w-96" />
<img src="/docs/v2/1sketch2.png" className="max-w-96" />

Create another rectangle with 10mm extra on each dimension! (5mm bigger on each side) Center this rectangle by pressing the dimension button and setting the values to 5mm.

<img src="/docs/v2/sketchdimension.png" className="max-w-96" />
<img src="/docs/v2/properdimension.png" className="max-w-96" />

It should look something like this when you're completed! 

<img src="/docs/v2/finishsketch.png" className="max-w-96" />

Select the outer rectangle and press extrude, extrude the outer by 13mm, and then do the same with the inner rectangle by 3mm.

<img src="/docs/v2/halfextrude.png" className="max-w-96" />

Thats the base of your case done! Next, lets create another sketch, this time creating circles with a diameter of 3.2mm, and 2.75mm from each edge. Extrude it to make it a hole! 

<img src="/docs/v2/holesforcase.png" className="max-w-96" />

<a name="top"/>
### Creating the top

Next, we will make the other half to our case. Start by creating yet another sketch, making it the same size as the bottom half of the case. Create the holes like before, and then create 4 14mm x 14mm squares. Follow these dimensions: 

<img src="/docs/v2/topsketch.png" className="max-w-96" />

Almost done, create another rectangle 18mm x 21mm, 17mm away from both edges and 5mm from the top, and extrude that plate by 3mm.

<img src="/docs/v2/topextrude.png" className="max-w-96" />

Right now our case looks a little ugly, its so blocky! Lets round the corners, press the Fillet button found in the top, and click on each edge and make it 2mm. Select the top edge of the case and make that 1mm. Should look as such:

<img src="/docs/v2/fillet.png" className="max-w-96" />
<img src="/docs/v2/edgeround.png" className="max-w-96" />

Make sure to cut out a port hole for your xiao, the best method is to add 3d models to your PCB, and test fit everything. You can import the .STEP file of your PCB, and test fit everything. After I test fitted everything, I made a few modifications.

<img src="/docs/v2/casebottom.png" className="max-w-96" />

<a name="finishing"/>
### Finishing Touches

Next, we will brand our case! This part will not be seen and is for us to be able to keep track of who's submission is whos. Go to the bottom of the case, or somewhere that won't be seen, and create a new sketch. Make a text box, and enter the name of your hackpad on it. 

<img src="/docs/v2/createtext.png" className="max-w-96" />

Extrude this sketch 0.2mm INTO the case, don't worry about the overhang! If you are getting an error when extruding, keep the font as Arial.

<img src="/docs/v2/extrudedtext.png" className="max-w-96" />

Thats it! Your case is now done.

<img src="/docs/v2/finalcase.png" className="max-w-96" />

I would also recommend importing 3d models of all your components to test fit everything: 

<img src="/docs/v2/testedcase.png" className="max-w-96" />

<a name="case_design_freecad"/>
## Creating your case in FreeCad

- Difficulty: 4/5, but guide is ultra detailed!

As a forenote, FreeCAD comes with a lot of quirks, so when you are blocked, google will be your best friend.

<a name="freecad_plate"/>
### Plate

First, download [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/), and open the application. Click on "New File". You should have something like this:

<img src="/docs/v2/newfreecad.png" className="max-w-112" />

Here is the layout of the view you should see:

<img src="https://wiki.freecad.org/images/d/d8/FreeCAD_interface_base_divisions.svg" className="max-w-112" />

Here are the names of the most important parts I will use in the tutorial:

- 1 and 2. The 3D view, showing the 3D model of your macropad.
- 3. The tree view, shows the hierarchy of objects in the document
- 4. The property editor, which allows viewing and modifying properties of the selected objects.
- 9. The toolbar area, where the toolbars are docked.
- 10. The workbench selector, where you select the active workbench.
- 11. The standard menu, which holds basic operations of the program.

After that, select the "Draft" workbench in the workbench selector, and draw your dxf file from the file explorer into FreeCAD. You should have something like this:

<img src="/docs/v2/draft.png" className="max-w-112" />

Now, select the outer lines that surround the keys, and delete them (Del key or rightclick and Delete). You should have something like this:

<img src="/docs/v2/freecadkeyhole.png" className="max-w-112" />

After that, go to the tree view, open up "layers" and then "0", then shift select all the items with the blue square icon:

<img src="/docs/v2/freecadselect.png" className="max-w-112" />

Click the draft to sketch button: (You might need to expand the toolbar menu by pressing ">>")

<img src="/docs/v2/drafttosketch.png" className="max-w-112" />

Now, add "layers" and "0" in the tree view to your selection and click delete. You should be left with something like this:

<img src="/docs/v2/deletelayer.png" className="max-w-112" />

Switch to the "Sketcher" workbench in the workbench selector. Click (**NOT** double click) the Sketch in the tree view, and click on validate sketch.

<img src="/docs/v2/validatesketch.png" className="max-w-112" />

Click the "Find" button under "Missing coincidences", then click the "Fix" button. After this click "Close". You should see something like this:

<img src="/docs/v2/goodsketch.png" className="max-w-112" />

Tip: You can click the "Top" on the cube on the 3d cube present at the top right of your screen to re-orientate your view!

Let's create the outline of the plate! First go back to KiCAD PCB editor and measure the dimensions of your board with the ruler tool. Click on one end of your Edge.Cuts and click again on the other end.

<img src="/docs/v2/ruler.png" className="max-w-96" />
<img src="/docs/v2/pcbsize.png" className="max-w-96" />

Now we know that the width of the board is the absolute value of x (41mm in my case), and the height is the absolute value of y (62.702mm) in my case. Go back to FreeCAD, select the "Part Design" workbench and click this button to create a new sketch:

<img src="/docs/v2/newsketch.png" className="max-w-96" />

On the left menu bar, select XY-plane and click Ok. Now click the small arrow next to the square at the top menu, and select Rounded rectangle.

<img src="/docs/v2/roundedrect.png" className="max-w-96" />

Draw the rounded rectangle around your keys, click to start drawing it and click again to end the rectangle. Click a third time to set the edge radius. The measurement doesn't matter at the moment.

<img src="/docs/v2/roundedrect2.png" className="max-w-128" />

Now select the dimension tool at the top.

<img src="/docs/v2/dimension.png" className="max-w-128" />

First, click on the quater circles at the edges and enter 5mm. (You can tweak this!)

<img src="/docs/v2/edges.png" className="max-w-128" />

Click ok. Now click on the straight line at the top, click again and enter "width-2*radius+5*2" (replace width with your board width, radius with your radius. The 5 at the end is our margin). In my case it is "41-2*5+5*2".

<img src="/docs/v2/toplength.png" className="max-w-128" />

Now do the same with the line at the right, but replace the width with the height.

After all these, click escape multiple times (sometimes the escape just doesn't register TwT). Click and drag the "Sketch" onto the "Body", you should have something like this:

<img src="/docs/v2/body.png" className="max-w-128" />

Double click Sketch001 again, now select the External Geometry tool and click on the bottom left and down lines:

<img src="/docs/v2/externalgeometry.png" className="max-w-128" />

Now go to KiCAD, measure how far your Edge.Cuts is to the yellow Silkscreen of your bottom-left switch.

<img src="/docs/v2/swoffset.png" className="max-w-96" />

Select the dimension tool again, click on the dotted wire on the left side, and the left edge of the case. Set the distance to the x distance you just measured + 5 (for me it's 3.99+5). Same for the bottom line and bottom dotted wire, y distance + 5.

<img src="/docs/v2/halfdonefreecadsketch.png" className="max-w-128" />

Now draw 4 circles on the edges with the circle tool:

<img src="/docs/v2/circletool.png" className="max-w-128" />

Use the dimension tool to set their diameter to 3.4mm (Click on the circles). And then set their distance to the edge by clicking on the center point, then one edge. It should be 3.3mm (radius - 3.4/2) for both sides. You should have something like this:

<img src="/docs/v2/doneplatesketch.png" className="max-w-96" />

Now go to kicad and measure the distance from the edge of the PCB to the USB port.

<img src="/docs/v2/kicadusbdist.png" className="max-w-96" />

Then open back FreeCAD, select the rectangle tool and draw a rectangle at the top:

<img src="/docs/v2/freecadrectangle.png" className="max-w-96" />

Use the dimension tool to define a width of 18mm and height of 26mm. Click T and click on the top of the rectangle, then the top of the rounded rectangle. After that use the distance tool to set the distance from the left of the rectangle to the left edge of the rounded rectangle to x_distance_in_kicad+0.75mm

<img src="/docs/v2/freecadplatehole.png" className="max-w-96" />

Select the Trim edge tool:

<img src="/docs/v2/freecadtrimedge.png" className="max-w-96" />

Then click two times the top side of the rectangle you just drew:

<img src="/docs/v2/freecadtrimmed.png" className="max-w-96" />

Double click escape, and you are done with the sketch!!! (My fingers are going to break tbh)

Now click on the pad button:

<img src="/docs/v2/freecadpad.png" className="max-w-96" />

And change the length to 3mm. Then rotate to the other side of the board! You can either use the middle mouse button+left mouse button, or the cube at the top-right. Go to the Model tab, select the sketch and click pocket button now

<img src="/docs/v2/freecadpocket.png" className="max-w-96" />
<img src="/docs/v2/selectsketch.png" className="max-w-128" />

Enter 10mm, check the Reversed radio button and press Ok

<img src="/docs/v2/holefreecad.png" className="max-w-128" />

Congrats! You finished the top plate.

Click File > Save to save the freecad project, and click on the Body in the tree view, then go to File > Export to export, select STL mesh as file format.

<a name="freecad_bottom"/>
### Bottom

First, create a new file, then a new sketch (Make sure you are in the Part Design workbench, still on the XY-plane).  Add a rounded rectangle, and make it have the same dimensions as the previous one (Use the distance tool to set the size). Then click C (This selects constraint coincident), click on any point of the rectangle, then the center of the xy axis:

<img src="/docs/v2/freecadbase.png" className="max-w-96" />

After that, draw the four circles like last time. with the same dimensions:

<img src="/docs/v2/freecadbasewhole.png" className="max-w-96" />

Double click escape, and click pad again. Enter 13mm:

Now click the top side of the case, and click on Create Sketch again. This time create a rectangle with the rectangle tool at the middle:

<img src="/docs/v2/freecadrectangle.png" className="max-w-96" />

First, use the external geometry tool and click on all 4 sides of our extruded case. Then use the dimension tool to set a distance between the edge of our rectangle and the edges of our extruded case of 5.2 mm.

<img src="/docs/v2/freecadholesketch.png" className="max-w-96" />

Double click escape, click the pocket tool and enter 10mm. You should have something like this:

<img src="/docs/v2/freecadpocket2.png" className="max-w-96" />

Click on one of the smaller sides of the case, and create a new sketch. Now go to kicad and measure the distance from the edge of the PCB to the USB port.

<img src="/docs/v2/kicadusbdist.png" className="max-w-96" />

Now draw a rectangle (non-rounded) in freecad. Use the external geometry tool to click on the right and top edges of the case. Set the width of the rectangle to 18mm and the height to 7.5mm. Click T, then click the top of the rect and the top edge of the case, after that use the distance tool to set the distance from the right of the rectangle to the right edge of the case to x_distance_in_kicad+0.75mm

<img src="/docs/v2/freecadusbsketch.png" className="max-w-96" />

Double click escape, and click the pocket tool, then enter 6mm. And you finished your case!!! 🎊🎊 (I'm going to die writing all this) The steps to save it are the same.

<img src="/docs/v2/freecadcase.png" className="max-w-96" />

And finally to test fit the case! Export the 3d model of your PCB. Open a new FreeCAD file, click File > Import, and select all your components (case, plate and 3d PCB).

Use the property editor to modify the position of the objects, so that they align: (The x, y, z fields, and rotate using the angle field)

<img src="/docs/v2/freecadproperty.png" className="max-w-96" />

After all this, you can assemble a 3d model like this and verify that everything fits:

PS. Yours should fit better, I make a tiny error to the measurements while creating the models :P. But I've corrected the sizes in the guide UwU

## Firmware

You can use the [QMK firmware](https://qmk.fm/) project as firmware! You can find out how to port your keyboard here: \
[QMK Porting Guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/porting_your_keyboard_to_qmk)

<a name="kmk"/>
Or if you wish, you can use kmk. It's made in python and can be hot reloaded.

Here is the starter code, with explenations in the comments:

```python
# You import all the IOs of your board
import board

# These are imports from the kmk library
from kmk.kmk_keyboard import KMKKeyboard
from kmk.scanners.keypad import KeysScanner
from kmk.keys import KC
from kmk.modules.macros import Press, Release, Tap, Macros

# This is the main instance of your keyboard
keyboard = KMKKeyboard()

# Add the macro extension
macros = Macros()
keyboard.modules.append(macros)

# Define your pins here!
PINS = [board.D3, board.D4, board.D2, board.D1]

# Tell kmk we are not using a key matrix
keyboard.matrix = KeysScanner(
    pins=PINS,
    value_when_pressed=False,
)

# Here you define the buttons corresponding to the pins
# Look here for keycodes: https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/blob/main/docs/en/keycodes.md
# And here for macros: https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/blob/main/docs/en/macros.md
keyboard.keymap = [
    [KC.A, KC.DELETE, KC.MACRO("Hello world!"), KC.Macro(Press(KC.LCMD), Tap(KC.S), Release(KC.LCMD)),]
]

# Start kmk!
if __name__ == '__main__':
    keyboard.go()
```

Save it in a main.py file in the firmware folder of your repo

Now after you received you macropad, plug it in and hold the bootloader button and press reset. You should see a external drive on your PC, [download circuitpython](https://downloads.circuitpython.org/bin/seeeduino_xiao_rp2040/en_US/adafruit-circuitpython-seeeduino_xiao_rp2040-en_US-9.2.4.uf2) and drag the file onto the drive. 

The board should automatically restart and be recognised as a new external drive. Now [download kmk](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), unzip it and copy the KMK folder and the boot.py file to the root of the external drive. Then create copy your main.py file over. And voila you got your macropad!

# Next steps
We just made a pretty cool macropad, but obviously there's a lot of cooler stuff out there - that's up to you to figure out! Again, don't copy this guide 1:1, add your own design into it.
