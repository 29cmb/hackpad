# Get your Hack Club keycaps!

Finally got your hackpad, eager to get your new custom hc keycap? Read on to find out how!

## Assemble your hackpad

Once you got the hardware, you'll need to assemble it! Your XIAO RP2040 should've come presoldered, but you'll need to do the rest. You should've gotten a soldering iron sent to you as well (haven't yet? DM me in slack!).

If you don't know how to solder, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKbJxytERvg) video by Colin from Adafruit provides a great primer on soldering. Definitely would recommend you watch

As always, if you ever need help, ask in #hackpad!

## Get the firmware working

Once that works, send a video in #hackpad! Let the world see.
