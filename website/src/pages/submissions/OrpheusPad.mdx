# Orpheuspad

Orpheuspad is a 4 key macropad with a rotary encoder, an OLED Display. It also has 2 WS2812B Leds, and uses QMK firmware

I made it because hack club needed a tutorial macropad and there weren't any good options....

## Fun facts
- This project took 20+ hours!!
- I redesigned it like 15 times...
- It glows underneath. Isn't that sick!!!


## What I learned

Something. hopefully...
