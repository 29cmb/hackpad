# winpad

Macropad to manage Sway/I3 window arrangement
- Includes a monitor customization mode (through DDC/CI)

## BOM

* 8x Cherry MX switches
* 8x Keycaps
* 1x EC11 encoder
* 1x EC11 cap
* 3x WS2812B LEDs
* 9x through-hole 1N4148 diodes
* 1x PCB
* 1x though-hole Seeed XIAO RP2040
* 1x 0.91" OLED + pin headers

_(I will provide/solder the 300 ohm resistor myself)_

## Case

The case has 5 parts:

* Base (3d-printed - white)
* Plate (laser cut acrylic)
* Top (3d-printed - white)
* Left and right stands (laser cut acrylic)

## Firmware

The keyboard needs an additional host-side daemon to run in order to display the current window status and handle DDC/CI requests. I haven't made this yet.
