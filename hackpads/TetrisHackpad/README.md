# Tetris Hackpad!!
Although now I think about it... it honestly feels like a keyboard.  

Either way, this was my first time designing a PCB, overall I think it went pretty well! The case is just a few sheets of acrylic with some standoffs to sandwhich the board in between.  

# PCB
Could the PCB be white? Still working on the silksreen. Renders coming soon!

# Bill of materials:
| Component                                 | Quantity |
|-------------------------------------------|----------|
| Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040                  | 1        |
| Gateron Milky Yellows Cherry MX Switches	| 10       |
| CherryMX 1.00u Kailh Sockets              | 10       |
| 1N4148W Diodes (D-SOD-123)                | 10       |
| USB C Receptacle 6P (GCT_USB4135-GF-A)    | 2        |
| 2.1mm Standoffs (TBD)                     | 8        |

<small>Note: I'm pretty sure the USB C receptables don't have to be *exactly* the same.. just the same amount of pins</small>
