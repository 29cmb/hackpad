# Tetris Hackpad!!
Although now I think about it... it honestly feels like a keyboard.  

Either way, this was my first time designing a PCB, overall I think it went pretty well! The case is just a few sheets of acrylic with some standoffs to sandwhich the board in between.

# PCB
Could the PCB be white? Still working on the silksreen. Sneak peak:

# Bill of materials
| Component                                 | Quantity |

<small>Note: I'm pretty sure the USB C receptables don't have to be *exactly* the same.. just the same amount of pins</small>

[@Jay](https://github.com/Jayx2u) I could not have figured out how to make the case, process images for the silkscreen, or render the PCB without you (or stay sane over the last two weeks for that matter). So, thank you!!
