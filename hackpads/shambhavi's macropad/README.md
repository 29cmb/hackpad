# my midi macropad :)
the (push switch) keys play the (musical) key's tonic triad notes. <br> turning the rotary encoder changes the key of the notes. <br> the OLED display shows what key you're in.

## inspiration 
i wanted to be able to make music more intuitively and easily than simply using a traditional mouse and keyboard setup.
## hardest challenges
- learning to use fusion360 ðŸ˜§
- learning what all these new words meant (use a matrix? configure the keyboard?? compile the code?!)

## fun facts!
when i get the hackpad, i'll probably try to code the OLED display and rotary encoder to act as a metronome :D
