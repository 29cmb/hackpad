# my midi macropad
## inspiration 
i wanted to be able to make music more intuitively and easily than simply using a traditional mouse and keyboard setup.
## hardest challenges
- learning to use fusion360 ðŸ˜§
- learning what all these new words meant (use a matrix? configure the keyboard?? compile the code?!)

## fun facts!
when i get the hackpad, i'll probably try to code the OLED display and rotary encoder to act as a metronome :)
