# Bear's Hack Pad

I was unable to get the firmware to compile but everything else was very fun to learn. I used Shapr3d instead of fusion 360 because that was easier to use. I have a lot of experience with blender so going to fusion 360 was infuriating because I kept trying to use it like blender, but shapr3d worked a lot more similarly to blender. I have been wanting to get into pcb design and learning Kicad for this project was fun and suprisingly the easiest part of the whole project.

#BOM:

- 11 cherry mx switches
- 1x EC11 Encoder
- 3x PCB (it said somewhere yall would send 3 idk)
- 12x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
- 1x oled display (128x32 is what I used in the schematic)
- 1x seeeduino board
