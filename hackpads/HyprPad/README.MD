# Hyprpad

### Why did I make it?
As a hyprland user, I really needed a quick way to switch between windows without having to press those stupid shortcuts! So, I designed HyprPad.

### What was the hardest part about this ?
I had tons of issues with Ki-cad libraries and my files. I accidently lost all of my PCB files for KiCAD. Had to recover them from my drive :)

### Bill of Materials
 - 4x M3 16mm screws 
 - 1x Seeed XIAO RP2040
 - 5x MX-Style switches (Blue)
 - 5x Blank DSA keycaps (Either White or Red)
 - Case (all black or a mix of Black and White)
