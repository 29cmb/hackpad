This is my macropad!

Its Gasket-mounted, hotswap, and has RGB!

# Note:

I am using two encoders. Depending on whether I get a D-shape or O-shape encoder, I have provided both models in the CAD folder. These models can be found at [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/347536-encoder-knob/files), the 30mm version.

The step files are also provided, if they are better for printing.
