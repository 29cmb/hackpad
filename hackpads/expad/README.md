# Bill of Materials
* 4x M3 16mm screws
* 1x PCB
* 3x 3d-Printed case parts
* 1x Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040
* 6x Cherry MX switches
* 6x DSA keycaps

This keypad is going to use the first six letters of the Greek alphabet to emulate F13-F18 for gaming use.
(I was originally going to have two of the keys be brand-new modifier keys but that would require me to bend the rules of reality... and I can't do that)

The keys are as follows:
Alpha (F13) Beta (F14) Gamma (F15)
Delta (F16) Epsilon (F17) Zeta (F18)
