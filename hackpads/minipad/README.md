# Minipad
My first time experimenting with PCB, keyboards, firmware and everything that comes along with it.
To keep things simple, I created a simple 4 switch grid (with one rotary encoder) direct wired to the microcontroller.

# BOM
- 3x Cherry MX switches
- 1x EC11 Encoder
- 1x PCB
- 1x Xiao Seeed RP2040
- 3x Blank DSA Key Caps
- 1x sticker to put on top
