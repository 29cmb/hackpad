* I will supply capacitors and resistors myself, as I (if I ask some people nicely) get them for free
* I know my hackpad mostly uses SMD components and herby confirm that I'll solder it myself
* I'm also aware that the XIAO RP2040 comes with THT pins soldered to it and that I'll have do desolder them to use 
it as an SMD component
