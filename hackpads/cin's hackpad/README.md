# Cinnamon's Macropad
It's a 5 key macropad with 2 SK6812MINI LEDs for lighting. It uses KMK firmware.
## Features
- A 3d printed case
- 2 SK6812MINI RGB LEDs to look cool
- 5 keys
## CAD Model
Everything fits together using M3 bolts and heatset inserts. This is how the case should fit together with the PCB inside. I made it in Fusion 360

## PCB
This is my PCB. I made it in KiCad. I should have added an image on the silkscreen layer :( .
