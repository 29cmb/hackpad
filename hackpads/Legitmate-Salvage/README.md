# Legitmate-Salvage
This is the Legitimate Salvage. It is a macro pad that includes ten keys, one rotary encoder, and one OLED screen. The firmware I set up allows three different tabs, and the OLED screen shows the current tab. This is my first time participating in a Hack Club event. I have only recently been learning Fusion and have never used KiCad or QMK, which was an exciting new opportunity. The hardest part was working with QMK, as I have no experience with firmware, and it was hard to find help or tutorials for the process.
