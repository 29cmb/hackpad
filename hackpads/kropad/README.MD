# kropad
A custom 3x2 macropad with a knob/rotary encoder. <br>
<br>
It was quite the challenge to design but I feel like I've learned alot from the process. The lack of instructions was frustrating at times but I pushed through. Hopefully I did everything right, cuz I would be very sad if something didn't fit, even with the tolerances. <br>

# BOM:
 - 5x Cherry MX Switches
 - 5x Black DSA Keycaps
 - 1x EC11 Rotary encoder
 - 1x Knob for EC11 (I was told these were available)
 - 4x M3x16mm screws
 - 4x M3 hex nuts
 - 1x Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040
 - 1x kropad PCB

# Colors
Just in case you need it: <br>
Base - Black<br>
Plate - Red<br>
Keycaps - Black<br>
<br>
<br>
Here's a screenshot showing that the pcb does fit inside the case:<br>
