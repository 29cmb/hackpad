# Capslock Light ++
My keyboard dosn't have an led for capslock, this is a completly overkill solution.

I Have designed a pad featuring 8 keys, a rotary encoder & an OLED.

## Future Upgrades 
Whats the point of a hackpad if you don't keep hacking on it? and my prefered method of hacking is in hardware.

1. RGB \
I added some solder points to the pcb that would allow me to conect WS2812b tape to it onece I have time to re-design the case to acomadate such lighting

2. MAGNETS!!! \
The case has points to glue 6x2mm magnets in for snap on customization.
These will incude bezzles that also show what the encoder dose, and stands that can interlock whith the dimond pattern on the bottom for more rigitiy than magnets alone could offer.
