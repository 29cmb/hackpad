### Inspiration

I wanted to create a macropad that allowed me to fidget. I created a macropad using 4 switches, 1 rp2040, and 2 leds. 

### Challenges

Believe it or not, this was my first time using Fusion 360! I watched numerous tutorials and guides and did a TON of googling, but in the end, I'm pretty proud of the final product. I had the most struggle figuring out how to make sketches, and with the new mouse controls, it definitely took me a while to get the hang of it.
