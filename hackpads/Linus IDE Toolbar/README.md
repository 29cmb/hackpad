A little macro pad with five buttons, an OLED screen and two RGB LEDs. The buttons are keybinds for "Debug", "Stop", "Resume", "Step Over", and "Step Into" in my IDE. The OLED screen can display useful information such as the current line.

I got inspired to make this by hackclubs hackpad project.

The hardest challenge I faced was learning how to use the software. I had never used any of the software before, so I had to learn everything from scratch.
