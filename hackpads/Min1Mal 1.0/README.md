## Inspiration

I wanted to uild a minimalist numpad that gave me back the keys I lost when going to a 75 percent keyboard.

## Challenges

I am terrible at anything software related, so first figuring out how to use KiCAD, which wasn't all that bad, but then figuring out the actual firmware for this as well.
