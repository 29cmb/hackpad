# Writeup
- 4x5 macropad with 2 LED screens, pretty basic tbh

## Overview of macropads
- can use as small keyboard if you connect all 3
- can use for macros like copy, paste etc

## PCB
- wires up in column and row config, with diodes in Column to row config
- I will solder all the surface mount components :)

## CAD
- case has 10/11 parts
- the standoffs will be 3d printed
- all DXF files can be made out of acrylic

## Firmware
- uses I2C to output to displays
- uses kmk to make the keyboard board
