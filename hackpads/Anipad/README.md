# Anipad

# BOM:
- 11x Cherry MX switches
- 1x EC11 Encoder
- 1x PCB
- 12x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
- 1x 0.91" OLED
- 3x M3 heated inserts, the same ones as in OrpheusPad
- 2x M3x12 screws
- 1x M3x20 screw
- 3D printed parts: print all the bodies in the Shell component, design on the bottom of Body 1 is printable without supports, as is the USB port

# Important note:
Assuming that there are three PCBs included in the mail, each with their own set of components, I'd like one pre-soldered and two unsoldered.
If only one of the PCBs comes with components, I'd like it pre-soldered. Also, for none of the PCBs would I like the OLED soldered, please.
Thanks.
