 # BOM

- 1x PCB
- 12x Slim Profile (aka Choc) MX swithces (up to user preference, but obviously yellows are supreme)
- 12x Throughhole 1N4148 Diodes
- 1x XIAO RP2040
- 20x WS2812B LEDs

## TODO for Revision 2:

- [ ] Add capacitive touch pads
- [ ] Add joystick or rotary encoder
- [ ] Reduce number of LEDs, spread the out more evenly, diffuse. Remove LED under MCU.
- [ ] Make 8 key variant, because why not?
