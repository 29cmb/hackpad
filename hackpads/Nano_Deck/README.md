# BOM:

- 14x Cherry MX switches (Gateron Milky Yellows as they are available at HQ)
- 2x EC11 Rotary Encoders with Switch
- 1x PCB
- 16x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
- 16x SK6812MINI LEDs (unsoldered - approved by Alex)
- 1x Seeed XIAO RP2040 (through hole)
- 1x 0.96 inch OLED display
- 28x Mill-Max 0305s (I haven't included them in the PCB as they can be soldered on the MX switch pins - 2 sockets are required for each switch)
- 1x PCF8574A IO expander (approved by Alex)
- 14x Keycaps
- 4x M3 heat-inserts (the same ones used in orpheuspad - I think M3xD4.6xL4)
- 4x M3 screws 25mm lenght (I have left 3.44 mm diameter holes for them and 6mm diameter for the screw tops so which ever fits.) (The total height of the case is 30mm at the heigted part (it has angled base), with the heat insert starting at 26mm till 30mm, and 25 mm at the lower part with the heat insert starting at 21 mm till 25mm, but I have left the 6mm part a bit lower for the heighted part so the screws fit.)

### 3d prints:

- 1x Case Top upper

- 1x Case Main Body
- 1x Case Main Body bottom (spacer)
- 1x Case Bottom
- 2x Rotary Encoders

### Laser cut:
