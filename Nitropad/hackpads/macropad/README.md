Bill of Materials
* 4x M3 16mm screws
* 1x PCB
* 3x 3d-printed case parts
* 1x Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040
* 6x Cherry MX switches 
* 6x DSA keycaps 
* 1x EC11 rotary encoder

My hackpad will be used as a keyboard controller for games with simple controls. The hardest part of this
project was the CAD since it required a lot of steps to design it. However I also gained a variety of 
different skills which will definetely be helpful for future projects.

switches - WASD, shift, space.
rotary encoder - volume
